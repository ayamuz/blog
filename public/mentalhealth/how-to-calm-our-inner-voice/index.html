<h1>How to calm our inner voice</h1>
<p>Most of us know how difficult it can be to deal with our inner voice. Although it might be beneficial during some creative situations or while we remember great experiences, it certainly can get in our way during difficult times. It makes us doubt ourselves and can even overtake our emotions. That negative inner voice is known as <em>chatter.</em></p>
<p>While it is easy to let our inner voice take control of our thoughts, different techniques are effective in dealing with this phenomenon. You might already be using some of them. The following suggestions come from the book <a href="https://amzn.to/3SPeH8q">‘Chatter’ by Ethan Cross</a>.</p>
<h3 id="things-to-help-yourself">Things to help yourself</h3>
<h4 id="creating-psychological-distance-through-third-person-talk">Creating psychological distance through third-person talk</h4>
<p>Repeating things like “you can do it” or talking to yourself in the third person creates a phenomenon called psychological distance, in which we can zoom out of a situation and gain a new perspective. For example, there are records of Fred Rodgers using this technique.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Am I kidding myself that I’m able to write a script again?… AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, IT’S JUST AS BAD AS EVER… GET TO IT, FRED. GET TO IT.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="creating-psychological-distance-through-advising-a-friend">Creating psychological distance through advising a friend</h4>
<p>Another similar way to create psychological distance is to pretend we are advising a friend going through the same situation as we are. This creates space between us and a specific problem, making it seem like the stakes are not as high.</p>
<h4 id="creating-psychological-distance-through-thinking-on-perspective">Creating psychological distance through thinking on perspective</h4>
<p>Some people might benefit from putting things into perspective within a broader view, such as the state of the world or events that our predecessors endured. It might help to realize that an uncomfortable conversation wasn’t as bad compared to a natural disaster or another event.</p>
<h4 id="rephrasing-adversities-as-a-challenge">Rephrasing adversities as a challenge</h4>
<p>Flipping the coin on an adverse situation might set us in a mindset that helps us overcome adversity. If we consider difficult situations as challenges, we might create the necessary environment to go through them.</p>
<h4 id="reinterpreting-physical-response-to-chatter">Reinterpreting physical response to chatter</h4>
<p>It can be beneficial to think about our increased heart rate or an upset stomach before giving a public talk as a response that will improve our performance during difficult situations instead of thinking about them as our body sabotaging us.</p>
<h4 id="normalizing-experience">Normalizing experience</h4>
<p>When we reframe our experiences as situations that other humans also experience, we can reflect on them from a distance.</p>
<h4 id="engaging-in-mental-time-travel">Engaging in mental time travel</h4>
<p>Another interesting recommendation is to imagine how things will be in the future. It is essential to ask ourselves how a specific situation will look in a month or in a year with the intention of realizing that our emotional discomfort is not permanent.</p>
<h4 id="changing-the-view">Changing the view</h4>
<p>This is what is commonly known as <em>being a fly on the wall</em>. Engaging with an issue as if we were looking at it from the outside helps us focus less on the emotional aspects of it and approach it in a more neutral manner.</p>
<h4 id="writing-expressively">Writing expressively</h4>
<p>Journaling is one of the first things we try to organize out thoughts, but there are certain things to keep in mind for this to work. First, we should let go of grammar and spelling; these aren’t as important right now to express feelings. Second, we should write our thoughts and feelings continuously for 15 to 20 minutes for three consecutive days.</p>
<h4 id="adopting-a-perspective-of-a-neutral-third-party">Adopting a perspective of a neutral third party</h4>
<p>Much like <em>being a fly on the wall</em>, this distances us from a negative experience. In this particular method, we focus on experiences that we have had with another person and imagine how a neutral third person would advise us or react to the conflict we have.</p>
<h4 id="using-a-lucky-charm-or-superstition">Using a lucky charm or superstition</h4>
<p>In the same way that the placebo effect is real, a lucky charm or superstition can quiet our anxieties and our internal voice.</p>
<h4 id="performing-rituals">Performing rituals</h4>
<p>Repeated and sequenced behaviors have been shown to increase our sense of control over the external circumstances causing distress. Importantly, these do not have to be religious or cultural; they can be anything you want. This is also useful if you perform a ritual with your friends or family, like toasting, always using the same words, because it creates a sense of community.</p>
<h3 id="things-to-support-others">Things to support others</h3>
<p>Simon Sinek explains <a href="https://youtu.be/NcaQUH2K-wo">on a podcast</a> how there is a full section of libraries called “self-help” but not “how to help others.” This resonates with me as I experience a lifestyle in America in which the self and the family unit seem to have the highest hierarchy. At the same time, the concept of the community gets shrunk down to just a few. However, helping others gives us a sense of purpose and provides an opportunity to use these techniques.</p>
<h4 id="addressing-cognitive-and-emotional-needs">Addressing cognitive and emotional needs</h4>
<p>One simple thing that we can do to help others in distress is to validate their feelings and how it is understandable that they feel upset. It is important to realize that addressing others’ emotional needs through validation is not enough, and we should try to address their cognitive needs with concrete advice on how to cope. For example, you can provide words of hope.</p>
<h4 id="providing-invisible-support">Providing invisible support</h4>
<p>We might perceive advice as a threat to our sense of autonomy when it is given without us asking. Because of this, you could employ other tactics like giving covert support in practical tasks like cleaning. It’s also useful to talk about emotional distress in a broad way, for example, “how stressful work can be.”</p>
<h4 id="telling-kids-to-be-a-superhero">Telling kids to be a superhero</h4>
<p>When we prompt children to think how their favorite superhero might react to a specific situation, we bring distance and a new perspective.</p>
<h4 id="giving-affectionate-touch">Giving affectionate touch</h4>
<p>Touch can be one of the most soothing things. Giving a hug, when welcomed, soothes our inner thoughts, and starts a hormonal cascade, releasing oxytocin to calm us.</p>
<h4 id="being-someone-elses-placebo">Being someone else’s placebo</h4>
<p>In some situations, we can act as someone else’s placebo; we can show how we’ve dealt with similar experiences in the past to give hope for a brighter future.</p>
<h3 id="things-to-harness-the-power-of-others">Things to harness the power of others</h3>
<p>Having in mind that we have learned how to help others, it is important to know how to ask others for help, whether actively or through indirect means.</p>
<h4 id="creating-committees-for-different-chatter-inducing-areas-of-your-life">Creating committees for different chatter-inducing areas of your life</h4>
<p>Not everyone will be familiar with every aspect of your life. It is important to identify a series of committees or groups that you think will understand each specific part of your life. A friend in your same field of work will understand work-related issues better than your friend from the gym.</p>
<h4 id="seeking-affectionate-touch">Seeking affectionate touch</h4>
<p>One skill that might be difficult to master is how to ask for affectionate touch. It is important to realize that asking for a hug from a loved one is ok.</p>
<h4 id="looking-at-photos-of-loved-ones">Looking at photos of loved ones</h4>
<p>Remembering good moments can change your outlook, and it also reminds you of the people that support you in different areas of your life.</p>
<h3 id="setting-the-right-environment">Setting the right environment</h3>
<p>When we feel like we are out of control and in distress, it might be useful to recover some agency through our environment. Tidying up, making lists, and arranging objects might be useful to give us a sense of control and mental order.<br>
Similarly, exposure to nature can have restorative effects, and seeking awe-inducing experiences can help us put our thoughts in perspective, as well as soothe our worries. It restores our executive batteries through a process called “soft fascination.”</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>Personally, I see some overlap between these techniques, and depending on the specific situation, they may be impractical. What I took away from them is that we have the power to change our mindset when we are given the right tools. It might be difficult to remember these techniques at the exact time when we need them, but it is useful to know they exist and that they are simple. More importantly, they highlight how we cannot function in the world as individuals without help from others. I see these techniques as an opportunity to practice them with others so that they are able to use them when we need their help.</p>
