# [What will make you happy?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSQjk9jKarg)
Most people take pride in their relationships and rarely mention wealth or academic accomplishments. This sounds obvious since loneliness is a real problem now. I'd like to see more people talking about how to deal with the [current loneliness issue](https://fortune.com/well/2023/11/15/global-initiative-loneliness-epidemic-vivek-murthy-surgeon-general-world-health-organization/).

Learn by doing; thinking about it is not enough.

The idea is that we need to be able to systematize the operations of the business so that it can function without the owner. The owner’s job is to learn how to grow the business and ultimately detach themselves from the roles of the technician and the manager.
# [Prevalence-induced concept change →](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aap8731)
We find problems even when they are not there. When a certain problem becomes less prevalent, we expand the definition of the problem.

> When blue dots became rare, participants began to see purple dots as blue; when threatening faces became rare, participants began to see neutral faces as threatening; and when unethical requests became rare, participants began to see innocuous requests as unethical. This “prevalence-induced concept change” occurred even when participants were forewarned about it and even when they were instructed and paid to resist it. Social problems may seem intractable in part because reductions in their prevalence lead people to see more of them.

The passion on learning a language and it’s culture is 👌.
